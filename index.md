# About Me
//TODO change this file to index.md

Hey there! I'm Pei Junwei, and I like anything to do with computer or art, with some experience in game development!

Seems like this is going to be a blog post before I am going to convert it to my personal website!! So exciting!

## Contents
Here will be a brief overview of what this page will entails:
+ Work Experience
+ Education

# Work Experience
## Ubisoft Singapore
---
This was an exciting time in my career to actually explore working in a triple-A game industry in Singapore! I joined the Ubisoft [C++]ampus Apprenticeship programme.

### Apprenticeship
I get to work with Rendering team in developing my own simple renderer from scratch in C++!
My C++ renderer code can be found at [this link](https://github.com/pjunwei95/myRenderer)

I also get to work with the UI team and participate in the sprint cycles with JIRA tasks and contribute code to the unannounced game!
### Digipen
I also have to attend lessons twice a week under Digipen Singapore which consists of C, C++ and introduction to OpenGL Graphics. The rest of the details will be highlighted in the education section. Here are some of the notable projects:

## SkillsFuture Singapore

### Blockchain Grant-Administration
This was a company-wide proof-of-concept that tests the viability of the blockchain technology.

### Skills Taxonomy Harmoniser (STH)
This is a proof-of-concept that I spearheaded solely and coded from scratch which dealt with several frameworks and is primiarily written in Java.

# Education
These are selected modules that are notable for their interesting projects involved.

## CS4247 - Graphics Rendering Techniques
---

In this project, we get to render graphics by utilising different techniques. Some include the raster graphics pipeline, viewing and transformation, real-time mapping techniques, real-time shadow algorithms, local reflection models, global illumination, distributed ray tracing, photon mapping, radiosity, volume rendering, image-based rendering and modelling, and strategies for anti-aliasing and photo-realism.

We get to utilise deferred ray-tracing for one of our algorithm implementations.

For this project, we are to render a scene in a room using the radiosity method, which utilise diffuse-to-diffuse method for colour computation. This method is similar to how the cornell box is rendered.

## NM3216 - Game Design
This is a pretty cool mod which exposes me first to game development and I get to work with people from different faculty background to create our very own game! It was a fun passion project that we created.
