# About Me
Hey there, and welcome to my personal page! My full name is Pei Junwei, and I like anything to do with computer or game development!

Feel free to take a look at some of the exciting stuff I had going on!

# Work Experience

## CSIT
---
I am currently working here with a focus in cybersecurity!

## Ubisoft Singapore
---
This was an exciting time in my career to actually explore working in a triple-A game industry in Singapore! I get to join Ubisoft under their [C++]ampus Apprenticeship programme and am very lucky to experience two teams!

### **Apprenticeship**
+ In general:
  + I get to actively participate in each sprint planning process which includes setting of objectives and follow up of assigned tasks 
  + Gain experience in the Agile methodology, including usage of JIRA as used in the game development process 
  + Collaborate in cross-functional teams with game designers, artists and development testers professionally 

+ Gameplay UI
  + I get to participate in the sprint cycles with JIRA tasks and contribute code to the unannounced game!
  + I was involved in UI, dealing with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) paradigm and contributed code with various in-house tools/Visual Studios C++.
  + I also worked with Technical Artists and UX designers to support JIRAs.

+ Rendering
  + I've learnt to design and write simple C++ [renderer](https://github.com/pjunwei95/myRenderer) from scratch, including simple array libraries, FPS controller and math library

### **Digipen**
I also have to attend lessons twice a week under Digipen Singapore which consists of C, C++ and introduction to OpenGL Graphics.

Here are some of the notable projects:

## SkillsFuture Singapore
### Blockchain Grant-Administration
This was a company-wide proof-of-concept that tests the viability of the blockchain technology.

### Skills Taxonomy Harmoniser (STH)
I designed and coded this Java app from scratch which utilises NLP and text classification to categorise skills taxonomies. It uilises Mongodb for its database and JSON for network communications.

# Education
These are selected modules that are notable for their interesting projects involved.


## NM3216 - Game Design
This is a pretty cool mod which exposes me first to game development and I get to work with people from different faculty background to create our very own game! It was a fun passion project that we created.

## CS4247 - Graphics Rendering Techniques
---

In this project, we get to render graphics by utilising different techniques. Some include the raster graphics pipeline, viewing and transformation, real-time mapping techniques, real-time shadow algorithms, local reflection models, global illumination, distributed ray tracing, photon mapping, radiosity, volume rendering, image-based rendering and modelling, and strategies for anti-aliasing and photo-realism.

We get to utilise deferred ray-tracing for one of our algorithm implementations.

For this project, we are to render a scene in a room using the radiosity method, which utilise diffuse-to-diffuse method for colour computation. This method is similar to how the cornell box is rendered.

# Special Mentions
Here are some of my other special mentions. Feel free to contact me at my personal email for more information!

My project gallery are as shown below. 

## CS4243 - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

This is a pretty fun module where we get to utilise python Open-CV libraries to perform Machine Learning on images.

One such example is utilising feature descriptors of different images to stitch a panorama.

## CS3240 - Interaction Design

Here, I collaborated with a team to develop a VR app showcasing NUS Museum. We even received offer by Hiverlab to utilise intellectual property for showcasing NUS. Unfortunately the rights are not ours and belong solely to NUS.

## CS3247 - Game Development Project

This was a very fun module where we get to work together in a team to produce a 3D VR shooting game which utilises music as its rythm. We used unity to import its local assets for the production.

## TUE: Data Engineering

I am so grateful to work with several international students during my exchange semester in the Technical University of Eindhoven, The Netherlands.
We managed to cluster different co-authors across different communities! This was done primarily using python and utilises the iceberg role similarity algorithm .

## TUE: Simulation in Computer Graphics

Similarly, I also get to work in a project where we explored simulation of computer graphics using C++ to model how graphics and physics interact with one another to produce a cloth physics visualisation.
